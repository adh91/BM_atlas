## Repository Goals
+ provide a resource to make the data generated from this project accessible
+ enable reproducible/transparent data reporting
+ provide analysis code to reproduce custom figures

If you have any questions or concerns, please submit an issue, contact the corresponding author(s), and/or contact Adam Harris (adh91@colostate.edu) or Dylan Ammons (dylan.ammons@colostate.edu).

## File structure:
üìÅ input : relevant metadata files and instructions for obtaining data associated with this study
üìÅ analysis : analysis code and source file used to complete the data analysis


## Supplemental data and potential uses:


### 1. Browse the complete annotated dataset
The proccessed dataset is avaliable for browsing via the UCSC Cell Browser portal. Using the portal you can explore feature expression throughout the dataset as well as obtain the transcriptomic signatures of each cell type though an interactive webpage.

Note: the cell type gene lists on UCSC Cell Browser are ordered by P value in descending order by default, you can toggle it to ascending to get the enriched markers at the top of the list. I will update if/when the default setting is modified.
